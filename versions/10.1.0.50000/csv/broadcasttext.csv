There are many ways to hone your craft in specialization. Sometimes you will gain insight from questing to help others, or discovering the wonders of the world, or even by accomplishing great feats and achievements.

One reliable way to practice your craft is to make something for the first time; this will always grant specialized knowledge. Another is to study the Draconic Treatises of your profession. Reading these treatises written by skilled scribes will surely lend insights.

There are many ways to hone your craft in specialization. Sometimes you will gain insight from questing to help others, or discovering the wonders of the world, or even by accomplishing great feats and achievements.

One reliable way to practice your craft is to make something for the first time; this will always grant specialized knowledge. Another is to study the Draconic Treatises of your profession. Reading these treatises written by skilled scribes will surely lend insights.

Author's Note: Introduction to be added. Focus on detailing theft of crystal focus from Nexus vault. 

Today, the ramifications of that battle between Shandaral and the blue dragonflight yet remain, lingering in every grain of arcane-tinged permafrost that still sits within the desecrated ruins of Shandaral. Even now, a keening din occupies the ruins as the spirits repeatedly relive their collective demise.

This thesis seeks to accomplish the following: first, to establish the cause of this arcane anomaly that binds the spirits to the place of their death; second, to discern an efficient means by which to undo said anomaly; and finally, to perform the requisite ritual and ensure that the spirits here may finally rest",240162,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
